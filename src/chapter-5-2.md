Small businesses should communicate the benefits of AI-enabled document management to employees to increase buy-in and reduce resistance to change. This includes highlighting how AI can improve efficiency, reduce manual labor, and provide insights and recommendations for better decision-making. By communicating the benefits of AI-enabled document management, small businesses can foster a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.

Addressing Job Security Concerns

AI technology may raise concerns about job security among employees. Small businesses should address these concerns by communicating how AI-enabled document management can free up time for more strategic tasks, such as customer service or business development. Additionally, small businesses can offer training and resources to help employees develop new skills and work alongside AI technology.
