In this chapter, we will explore different types of AI techniques and platforms used for document management and workflow automation.

Intelligent Document Recognition
--------------------------------

Intelligent document recognition is a technology that recognizes the type of document and extracts relevant data. This technology can be used to automate processes such as invoice processing or form recognition, reducing manual input and improving accuracy.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
---------------------------------

Natural language processing (NLP) is a technology that enables computers to analyze and process human language. NLP can be used for tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and entity recognition. By analyzing text data, NLP can help small businesses gain new insights into their documents and improve document management practices.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
-----------------------------------

Optical character recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts scanned images or PDFs into searchable text. OCR can be used to digitize physical documents, making them easier to search and retrieve. Additionally, OCR can be used to extract specific data points, such as names or dates, from documents for further analysis and processing.

Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
